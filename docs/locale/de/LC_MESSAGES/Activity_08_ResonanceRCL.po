"A resonant circuit, also called a tuned circuit consists of an inductor "

"The resonance frequency is defined as the frequency at which the "

"defined as the frequency at which the impedance is purely real (that is, "
"purely resistive). This occurs because the impedances of the inductor and"
" capacitor at resonance are equal but of opposite sign and cancel out. "
"Circuits where L and C are in parallel rather than series actually have a"
" maximum impedance rather than a minimum impedance. For this reason they "
"are often described as antiresonators_, it is still usual, however, to "
