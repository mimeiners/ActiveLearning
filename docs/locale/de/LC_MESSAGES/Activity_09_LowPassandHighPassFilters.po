"The impedance of an inductor is proportional to frequency and the "
"impedance of a capacitor is inversely proportional to frequency. These "
"characteristics can be used to select or reject certain frequencies of an"
" input signal. This selection and rejection of frequencies is called "
"filtering, and a circuit which does this is called a filter."

"If a filter passes high frequencies and rejects low frequencies, then it "
"is a high-pass filter. Conversely, if it passes low frequencies and "
"rejects high ones, it is a low-pass filter. Filters, like most things, "
"aren't perfect. They don't absolutely pass some frequencies and "
"absolutely reject others. A frequency is considered passed if its "
"magnitude (voltage amplitude) is within 70% or :math:`1/sqrt(2)` of the "
"maximum amplitude passed and rejected otherwise. The 70% frequency is "
"called corner frequency, roll-off frequency or half-power frequency."
