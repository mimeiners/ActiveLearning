"Here we will explore an inductor based circuit which can produce an "
"output voltage which is higher than the supplied voltage. This class of "
"circuits are referred to as DC to DC converters or boost regulators. In "
"this experiment the voltage from a 1.5 V supply ( battery ) will be "
"boosted to a voltage high enough ( ~ 5 V) to drive two LEDs in series. "
"**Note that forward voltage of LED is typically 1.8V although for some "
"diodes it can go up to 3.3V (blue LED)**"

"A boost converter (step-up converter) is a DC-to-DC power converter that "
"steps up voltage (while stepping down current) from its input (supply) to"
" its output (load). It is a class of switched-mode power supply (SMPS) "
"containing at least two semiconductors (a diode and a transistor) and at "
"least one energy storage element: a capacitor, inductor, or the two in "
"combination. To reduce voltage ripple, filters made of capacitors "
"(sometimes in combination with inductors) are normally added to such a "
"converter's output (load-side filter) and input (supply-side filter)."

"On figure 1 basic DC-DC boost converter circuit is shown. To the "

"operation of DC-DC boost converter either constant load or load "
"regulation is needed**. Without regulation any change of the load will "
"affect the output voltage level. Therefore we have set 200 "
":math:`\\Omega` load to stabilize output voltage. Parallel to the load "
"two LED diodes in series with 1K resistors are added. Note that adding or"
" removing additional LEDs parallel to the load will not affect output "
"voltage since current drawn by LED will be much smaller than current "
"drawn by 200 :math:`\\Omega` load. **LEDs are used as indicators that our"

"Red Pitaya STEMlab outputs can generate voltage signals with maximal "
"output range of +/- 1V (2Vpp). For MOSFET switching the higher signal "
"amplitudes are required.Because of that we have used two NPN transistors "
"in switching mode as intermediate stage between OUT1 switching signal and"
" MOSFET transistor. OUT1 square signal will switch ON and OFF first NPN "
"transistor causing its collector voltage to swing between 0-5V. This "
"collector voltage then controls second NPN transistor and its collector "
"voltage, also swinging between 0-5V, will then switch ON/OFF the MOSFET "
"transistor. The reason why two NPN transistors are used is to have OUT1 "
"and MOSFET gate signal in phase. I.e when OUT1 is high the signal on the "
"MOSFET gate should be also high. Using one transistor will cause 180 "
"phase delay.  **You can also see the other more important problem here. "
"If we use only one NPN transistor then when OUT1 is constantly turned OFF"
" the MOSFET transistor will be constantly turned ON producing short "
"circuit: battery - inductor - mosfet - gnd**. Using two NPN transistor "
"will prevent this happening."
