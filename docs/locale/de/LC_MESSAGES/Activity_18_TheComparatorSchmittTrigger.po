"A Differential Voltage Comparator such as the AD8561_ from the analog "
"parts kit has a pinout similar in many ways to that of a conventional "
"opamp but with many important differences (figure 1). There are the usual"
" :math:`V_+` and :math:`V_-` power supply pins but a comparator will also"
" have a ground (GND) pin as well. The differential :math:`+IN` and "
":math:`-IN` pins are essentially the same as a conventional op-amp. There"
" will also be an output pin as in an opamp but there is often a second "
"“inverting” ( or complementary ) output. Also, while the voltage at the "
"output of an opamp can generally swing close to the :math:`+` and "
":math:`-` supply rails, the output of a comparator will swing only "
"between ground(gnd) and the :math:`+` supply. This makes the output more "
"like a digital signal and compatible with standard logic gates such as "
"TTL or CMOS. The voltage comparator can be thought of as a single bit "
"analog-to-digital converter (ADC). The AD8561 also includes a LATCH input"
" which will latch or freeze the output and prevent it from changing even "
"if the inputs change."

"Voltage Comparators are extremely sensitive to the noise and glitches on "

"Usually our intuition is to correlate high possibility of noise issues "

"always true. If we increase OUT1 (:math:`V_{in}`) frequency to 100kHz the"
" switching noise will be much lower. Way is that? You may think like "
"this: Voltage comparator has very sensitive inputs and it is constantly "
"comparing values of :math:`V_{in}` and :math:`V_{ref}`. Now let's set "
":math:`V_{in}` to be noiseless signal and :math:`V_{ref} = DC +(-) "
"A_{noise}`. When triangle wave :math:`V_{in}` signal is slowly "
"approaching :math:`V_{ref}` the voltage comparator will start switching "
"and if the :math:`V_{ref}` amplitude swingings around DC value by "
":math:`A_{noise}` the comparator output will change states according to "
"the :math:`V_{in}  - (V_{ref} = DC +(-) A_{noise})` ratio. So, as long "
":math:`V_{in}` amplitude **stays in the range** of :math:`V_{ref} = DC "
"+(-) A_{noise}` value the comparator output will effectively switch on "
":math:`A_{noise}` and not on the input signals. Once :math:`V_{in}` goes "
"below :math:`V_{ref} = DC - A_{noise}` or above :math:`V_{ref} = DC + "
"A_{noise}` the comparator output will switch high or low but now on input"
" signal values not on noise values. You can see that **low frequency "
"triangle wave** :math:`V_{in}` amplitude **will spend more time** near "
":math:`V_{ref} = DC +(-) A_{noise}` causing voltage comparator to produce"
" noisy output while **high frequency triangle wave** :math:`V_{in}` "
