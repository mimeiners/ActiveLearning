"The Bode analyzer is an ideal application for measuring frequency "
"responses of the passive/active filters, complex impedances and any other"
" electronic circuit. The Gain/Phase frequency response can be used to "
"characterize any device under test completely, you can perform linear and"
" logarithmic sweeps. Gain and Phase can be measured from 1Hz to 60MHz. "
"The basic user interface enables quick interaction and parameter "
"settings. The Bode analyzer can be used for the measurement of Stability "
"of control circuits such as the DC/DC converters in power supplies, "
"Influence of termination on amplifiers or filters, Ultrasonic and piezo "
"electric systems and similar."

"A Band Pass Filter allows a specific range of frequencies to pass, while "
"blocking or attenuating lower and higher frequencies. It passes "
"frequencies between the two cut-off frequencies while attenuating "
"frequencies outside the cut-off frequencies. One typical application of a"
" band pass filter is in Audio Signal Processing, where a specific range "
"of frequencies of sound are desired while attenuating the rest. Another "
"application is in the selection of a specific signal from a range of "
"signals in communication systems. A band pass filter may be constructed "
"by cascading a High Pass RL filter with a roll-off frequency :math:`f_L` "
"and a Low Pass RC filter with a roll-off frequency :math:`f_H`, such "
"that:"
