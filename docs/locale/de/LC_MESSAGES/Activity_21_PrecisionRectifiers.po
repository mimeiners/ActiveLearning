"The purpose of this experiment is to investigate precision rectifiers or "
"absolute value circuits. Rectifiers, or 'absolute-value' circuits are "
"often used as detectors to convert the amplitudes of AC signals to DC "
"values to be more easily measured. For this type of circuit, the AC "
"signal is first high-pass filtered to remove any DC component and then "
"rectified and perhaps low pass filtered."

"As we have seen in the simple_ rectifier_ circuits constructed with "
