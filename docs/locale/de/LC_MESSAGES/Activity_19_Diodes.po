"The LED is a junction diode that emits light when forward biased. "

"the visible light emitting property, it is necessary to fabricate the LED"

"An LED is a semiconductor device that emits electromagnetic radiation at "
"optical and infrared frequencies. The device is a PN junction diode made "
"from p-type and n-type semiconductors, usually GaAs, GaP or SiC. They "
"emit light only when an external applied voltage is used to forward bias "
"the diode above a minimum threshold value. The gain in electrical "
"potential energy delivered by this voltage is sufficient to force "
"electrons to flow out of the n-type material, across the junction "
"barrier, and into the p-type region. This threshold voltage for the onset"
" of current flow across the junction and the production of light is "
":math:`V_0`. The emission of light occurs after electrons enter into the "
"p-region (and holes into the n-region). These electrons are a small "
"minority surrounded by holes (essentially the anti-particles of the "
"electrons) and they will quickly find a hole to recombine with. "
"Energetically, the electron relaxes from the excited state (conduction "
"band) to the ground state (valence band). The diodes are called light "
"emitting because the energy given up by the electron as it relaxes is "
"emitted as a photon. Above the threshold value, the current and light "
"output increases exponentially with the bias voltage across the diode. "
