"Red Pitaya STEMlab outputs can generate voltage signals with maximal "

"inverting_ opamp configuration to enable OUT1/OUT2 signal amplification "
"achieving voltage swing between +4.7V  to -3.2V. An OP484 will be "
"supplied from STEMlab +5V and -3.3V voltage rails. Gain of the inverting "
"amplifier will be set to ~5, where :math:`R_i  = 2.2k \\Omega` and "
