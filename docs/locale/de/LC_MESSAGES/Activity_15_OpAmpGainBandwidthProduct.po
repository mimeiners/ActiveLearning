"The forward gain, :math:`G` is defined as the gain of the op-amp when a "
"signal is fed differentially into the amplifier with no negative feedback"
" applied. This gain is ideally infinite at all frequencies, but in a real"
" op-amp is finite_, and depends on the frequency. At low frequency the "
"gain is maximum, decreases linearly with increasing frequency, and has a "
"value of one at the frequency commonly referred to as the unity gain or "
"cut-off frequency :math:`f_{c}` (in equation form, :math:`G(f_c)=1`). For"
" the **OP97 op-amp**, the **unity gain frequency is 900 kHz**, the "
"**open-loop gain at this frequency is simply one**. This is also the "
"Closed-Loop Bandwidth or the maximum frequency when the feedback is "
"configured with a closed loop gain of 1. :math:`G_f` is defined as the "
"**gain-bandwidth product**, :math:`GBW`, and for all input frequencies "
"this product is constant and equal to :math:`f_c`. The gain can be "
"specified as a simple number (magnitude) or in dB(decibel)."

"Build the circuit shown in figure 2 on your solderless breadboard to "
"measure the frequency response of a inverting amplifier configured with a"
" closed loop gain of 1000. Because the circuit’s gain is so high, the "
"circuit needs to be driven with a very small input signal. In order to "
"generate small signal with the STEMlab generator, a 1/1000 voltage_ "
"divider_, [R3 - (R4||R1)], is used to reduce the 2V p2p sine signal to 2 "
"mV p2p at the inverting amplifier input. R4 and R1 are effectively in "
"parallel due to the “virtual ground” at pin 2. The parallel combination "
"of R4 and R1 will be 50 Ω which with the 47 KΩ R3 results in a divider "
"ratio close to 1/1000."
