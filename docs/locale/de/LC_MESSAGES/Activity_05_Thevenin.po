"Thévenin's Theorem is a process by which a complex circuit is reduced to "
"an equivalent circuit consisting of a single voltage source (V\\ "
":sub:`TH`\\) in series with a single resistance (R\\ :sub:`TH`\\) and a "
"load resistance (R\\ :sub:`L`\\). After creating the Thévenin Equivalent "
"Circuit, the load voltage V\\ :sub:`L`\\ or the load current Il may be "
"easily determined."

"One of the principal uses of Thévenin's theorem is to replace a large "
"portion of a circuit, often a more complicated and uninteresting part, by"
" a simple equivalent. The new simpler circuit enables rapid calculations "
"of the voltage, current, and power which the more complicated original "
"circuit is able to deliver to a load. It also helps to choose the optimal"
" value of the load (resistance) for maximum power transfer."
