"In this tutorials we use the terminology taken from the user manual when "
"referring to the connections to the Red Pitaya STEMlab board hardware_. "
"Impedance_ analyzer_ application is used to measure RLC circuit impedane "
":math:`Z(f)`. **Here we use Impedance analyzer application without LCR "
"meter frontend as described** HERE_. The Impedance analyzer application "
"enables measurements of Impedance, Phase and other parameters of the "
"selected DUT (Device Under Test). Measurements can be performed in the "
"Frequency sweep mode with 1Hz frequency resolution or in the Measurements"
" sweep mode with the desired number of measurements at constant "
"frequency. The selectable frequency range is from 1Hz to 60MHz, although "
"the recommended frequency range is up to 1MHz. The impedance range is "
"from 0.1 Ohm to 10 Mohm. When using the Impedance analyzer application "
"with the LCR Extension module, insert 0 in the shunt resistor field."

"The chief electrical characteristic of a dynamic loudspeaker is its "
"electrical impedance as a function of frequency. It can be visualized by "
"plotting it as a graph, called the impedance curve. The most common type "
"of loudspeaker is an electro-mechanical transducer using a voice coil "
"connected to a diaphragm or cone. The voice coil in moving coil "
"loudspeakers is suspended in a magnetic field provided by a permanent "
"magnet. As electric current flows through the voice coil, from an audio "
"amplifier, the electro-magnetic field created by the current in the coil "
"reacts against the permanent magnet's fixed field and moves the voice "
"coil (also the cone). Alternating current will move the cone back and "
"forth. The movement of the cone vibrates the air producing the sound."

"The moving system of the loudspeaker, including the cone, cone "
"suspension, spider and the voice coil, has a certain mass and compliance."
" This is most commonly modeled as a simple mass suspended by a spring "
"that has a certain resonant frequency at which the system will vibrate "
"most freely."

"This frequency is known as the “free-space resonance” of the speaker and "
"is designated by :math:`F_S`. At this frequency, since the voice coil is "
"vibrating with the maximum peak-to-peak amplitude and velocity, the back-"
"emf generated by coil motion in a magnetic field is also at its maximum. "
"This causes the effective electrical impedance of the speaker to be at "
"its maximum at :math:`F_S`, known as :math:`F_{max}`. For frequencies "
"just below resonance, the impedance rises rapidly as the frequency "
"approaches :math:`F_S` and is inductive in nature. At resonance, the "
"impedance is purely resistive and beyond it, as the impedance drops, it "
"looks capacitive. The impedance reaches a minimum value, :math:`Z_{min}`,"
" at some frequency where the behavior is mostly (but not perfectly) "
"resistive over some range of frequencies. A speaker's rated or nominal "
"impedance, :math:`Z_{nom}`, is derived from this :math:`Z_{min}` value."

":math:`R_{dc}` is the dc resistance of the loudspeaker as measured with a"
" DC ohmmeter. The dc resistance is often referred to as the :math:`DCR` "
"in a speaker/subwoofer data sheet. The dc resistance measurement is "
"usually less than the driver's nominal impedance :math:`Z_{nom}`. "
":math:`R_{dc}` is typically less than the specified loudspeaker impedance"
" and the novice loudspeaker enthusiast may be fearful that the driver "
"amplifier will be overloaded. However, because the inductance :math:`L` "
"of a speaker increases with an increase in frequency, it is unlikely that"
" the driver amplifier actually sees the dc resistance as its load."

":math:`L` is the voice coil inductance usually measured in milliHenries "
":math:`mH`. Typically, the industry standard is to measure the voice coil"
" inductance at :math:`1kHz`. As frequencies increase above :math:`0Hz`, "
"there is a rise in impedance above the :math:`R_{dc}` value. This is "
"because the voice coil acts as an inductor. Consequently, the overall "
"impedance of a loudspeaker is not a constant impedance, but can be "
"represented as a dynamic profile that changes with input frequency as we "
"will see when we make measurements. Maximum impedance, :math:`Z_{max}`, "
"of the loudspeaker occurs at the resonant frequency, :math:`F_s`, of the "
"loudspeaker."

":math:`F_s` is the resonant frequency of a loudspeaker. The impedance of "
"a loudspeaker is a maximum at :math:`Z_s`. The resonant frequency is the "
"point at which the total mass of the moving parts of the loudspeaker "
"become balanced with the force of the speaker suspension when in motion. "
"The resonant frequency information is important to prevent an enclosure "
"from ringing. In general, the mass of the moving parts and the stiffness "
"of the speaker suspension are the key elements that affect the resonant "
"frequency. A vented enclosure (bass reflex) is tuned to :math:`F_s` so "
"that the two work in unison. As a rule, a speaker with a lower "
":math:`F_s` is better for low-frequency reproduction than a speaker with "
"a higher :math:`F_s`."
