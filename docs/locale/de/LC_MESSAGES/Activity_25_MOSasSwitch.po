"A MOS FET (NMOS) device can be used in many circuit configurations such "
"as an amplifier, oscillator, filter, rectifier or just used as an on-off "
"switch. If the FET is biased into the saturation region, it will operate "
"as an amplifier or other linear circuit, if biased alternately in the "
"linear (triode) region and cut-off region, then it is being used as a "
"switch, allowing current to flow or not to flow in other parts of the "
"circuit. This lab activity describes the NMOS device when operated as a "
"switch."

"An actual NMOS switch differs from the ideal switch in several aspects. "
"In practice, even in cutoff there is some small leakage current through "
"the transistor. Also, in triode, there is always some voltage dropped "
"across the transistor's internal resistance, :math:`R_{ON}`. Typically, "
"this will be between 0.1 and 0.2 V in triode depending on the drain "
"current and size of the device. These variations from the ideal are "
"generally minor with a properly sized device, so we can assume near ideal"
" conditions when analyzing or designing a NMOS switch circuit."

"Tne common application for a NMOS (or any other) switch is to drive an "
"LED. An LED driver is shown in figure 2. The driver shown in this figure "
"is used to couple a low current part of the circuit to a relatively high "
"current device (the LED). When the output from the low current circuit is"
" low (0 V), the transistor is in cutoff and the LED is off. When the "
"output from the low current circuit goes high (above :math:`V_{TH}`), the"
" transistor is driven into triode and the LED lights. The driver is used "
"because the low-current part of the circuit may not have the current "
"capability to supply the 20 mA (typical) required to light the LED to "
"full brightness."
