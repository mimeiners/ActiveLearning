"A bipolar junction transistor (BJT) can be used in many circuit "
"configurations such as an amplifier, oscillator, filter, rectifier or "
"just used as an on-off switch. If the transistor is biased into the "
"linear region, it will operate as an amplifier or other linear circuit, "
"if biased alternately in the saturation and cut-off regions, then it is "
"being used as a switch, allowing current to flow or not to flow in other "
"parts of the circuit. This experiment describes the BJT when operated as "
"a switch."

"Condition 1 guarantees that the circuit is driven into the cutoff region "
"by the input. Conditions 2 and 3 assure that the transistor will be "
"driven into the saturation region. An actual BJT switch differs from the "
"ideal switch in several aspects. In practice, even in cutoff there is "
"some small leakage current through the transistor. Also, in saturation, "
"there is always some voltage dropped across the transistor's internal "
"resistance. Typically, this will be between 0.2 and 0.4 V in saturation "
"depending on the collector current and size of the device. These "
"variations from the ideal are generally minor with a properly sized "
"device, so we can assume near ideal conditions when analyzing or "
"designing a BJT switch circuit."
