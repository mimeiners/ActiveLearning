"The high intrinsic gain of the op-amp and the output saturation effects "
"can be exploited by configuring the op-amp as a comparator as in figure "
"14. This is essentially a binary-state decision-making circuit: if the "
"voltage at the “+” terminal is greater than the voltage at the “-” "
"terminal, :math:`V_{in}` > :math:`V_{ref}` , the output goes “high” "
"(saturates at its maximum value). Conversely if :math:`V_{in}` < "
":math:`V_{ref}` the output goes “low”. The circuit compares the voltages "
"at the two inputs and generates an output based on the relative values. "
"Unlike all the previous circuits there is no feedback between the input "
"and output; we say that the circuit is operating “open-loop”."
