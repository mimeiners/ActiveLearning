"In this tutorials we use the terminology taken from the user manual when "
"referring to the connections to the Red Pitaya STEMlab board hardware_. "
"Impedance_ analyzer_ application is used to measure RLC circuit impedane "
":math:`Z(f)`. Alongside Impedance analyzer application for impedance "
"measurement we have used an LCR_ meter_ frontend_. Although LCR meter "
"frontend is intended when using LCR meter application it can be also used"
" for Impedance analyzer application. The Impedance analyzer application "
"enables measurements of Impedance, Phase and other parameters of the "
"selected DUT (Device Under Test). Measurements can be performed in the "
"Frequency sweep mode with 1Hz frequency resolution or in the Measurements"
" sweep mode with the desired number of measurements at constant "
"frequency. The selectable frequency range is from 1Hz to 60MHz, although "
"the recommended frequency range is up to 1MHz. The impedance range is "
"from 0.1 Ohm to 10 Mohm. When using the Impedance analyzer application "
"with the LCR Extension module, insert 0 in the shunt resistor field."
